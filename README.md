<b>here we code a program, which is a web scraper, extracts 8 cryptcryptocurrencies prices from <a href="https://fcsapi.com/document/crypto-api">this website</a> (which provides prices in JSON form and make extracting process very very easier, thanks for it!).</b>
<br><br>datas will be refreshed every 4 minutes and program prints those in console.
<br><br>this program is just a data miner and you can use it in any program as extractor part
<br><br>Note : you should install all needed libraries and chrome web-driver (for another browser, you should change the web driver in the code)
